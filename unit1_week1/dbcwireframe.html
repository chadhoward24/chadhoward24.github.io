	<p>This site is dedicated to providing users with the sports information they desire. The content is massive. It provides the user with access to articles, photos, videos, blogs, and much more. Organizing the material in a clear and user-friendly fashion is the visual challenge the site must overcome and I believe they've accomplished that.</p> 
	<h2>ESPN</h2>

	<p>Just like CBS Sports, this site provides access to all that's happening in the world of sports. They too have the issue of how to manage the volume of information located on the site. All their info is easily accessible to the user through an abundance of well organized links.</p>
	<h2>Eleven Warriors</h2>

	<p>Everything Buckeye! If you're an Ohio State fan, this is the site for you. The site doesn't have near the content volume that the other two sites I've listed has, so it makes for a very easy interaction with the user. It provides a very simple tag at the top for the user to easily view info relating to football, basketball, or recruiting.</p>
