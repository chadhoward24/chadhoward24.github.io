	<h2 style = "text-align: center"><a href = "http://www.cbssports.com">CBS Sports</a></h2>
		<p>I'm a huge sports fanatic! I can't get enough! My wife says I'm addicted. Whenever I need a fix, CBS Sports.com is one of my favorite sites to go to. It allows me to stay up-to-date with what's going on in the world of sports without having to sit through an entire Sportcenter to get my information.</p>
		<p>Visually, the home page may seem a little busy at first if you're a newcomer to the site but I think it's actually organized quite nicely. The first thing that draws your attention on the home page is a huge image referencing the top story at the moment. If that doesn't interest you, then just to the right is a list of all the current top headlines. There's also a bar at the top of the page that lists various sports if you want find information relating to a particular one. One of my favorite features is right below this tab, which is a full scoreboard that can easily be filtered by sport.  Overall, it's extremely simple to navigate the site. Everything is just a click or two away. There's so much content that I can be on this site for hours if I haven't visited in awhile. Some might say it can even become addicting.</p>

		<p> What can I say, I'm passionate about sports. Maybe my wife is right. Don't ever tell her I said that!</p>
		<p> Espn.com is actually set up in a similiar fashion as CBS Sports.com. The home page contains all the same features so I won't repeat myself from above. Visually, the biggest difference to me is that the ads are a little more prominent which can be annoying.</p>

	<h2 style = "text-align: center"><a href = "http://www.elevenwarriors.com">Eleven Warriors</a></h2>
		<p>This one is probably my favorite site. It's solely dedicated to Ohio State football and basketball news. Nationally, the Buckeyes have a lot of haters so it's a great place for me to get a friendly perspective. The site keeps things simple, both visually and design-wise. The home page is very clean, it doesn't overwhelm you at all. The images are big and vibrant, along with their associated text. Navigation of the site is an absolute breeze. They really do a good job of providing a fun, fresh perspective. If you're a Buckeye fan, this is the site for you!</p>
